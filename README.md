# pizzaRestaurantWebsite
Making use of materialize's swipeable tabs for a web application.
Working on the interface for a website that can be used on a restaurant to automate orders. Basically what I intend to do is to make a website
that is easy to use and that posses touch gestures so that it can be easily used.
